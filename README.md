# Introduction to SOAR — Threat Intelligence Automation Lab

This repository documents my hands-on lab experience with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) concepts and workflows using a simulated SOC environment.

## Objective

The goal of this lab was to understand how SOAR improves SOC efficiency by automating threat intelligence integration, incident investigation, and response actions.

## Key Concepts Learned
